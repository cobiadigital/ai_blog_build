      <p class="body text-start"><p>In Jaqualine Kelm&#39;s book,&nbsp;Appreciative Living she further lays out the constructionist principle:</p>

<p>Life is not experienced in a vacuum. We simultaneously integrate our past and present beliefs as we construct a new reality with others. As we hear over and over from different sources that being responsible is a good way to live, we begin to view that as &quot;truth.&quot;&nbsp;We come to believe that it is better to follow the rules, do what we promise, and adhere to the standards and norms of our society. We carry that truth&nbsp;into our next experience and act accordingly. It is only &quot;truth&quot;¬ù for us, from our relative perspective and framework of understanding. It will be viewed differently by others.</p>

<hr />
<p>What&#39;s one thing you are grateful for?</p>

<p>It could be a conversation you had...&nbsp;a few moments of walking in the sun...&nbsp;a particular feeling...</p>

<p>Name another thing...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Name a third...</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>Now think about what role you played in these three things.</p>

<hr />
<p>What is something, no matter how small, you can do today that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>It could be ride a bike, bake cookies, play some music...</p>

<hr />
<p>Thich Nhat Hanh says: &quot;Our own life is the instrument with which we experiment with truth&quot;</p>

      <p class="body text-start"><p>Today&rsquo;s Appreciative Narrative moment comes from Chapter 4 of Conversations worth Having by Jacky Stravos and Cherri Torres.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s Driving Your Conversations?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Appreciative Inquiry teaches human interactions rest on a set of five principles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first is the Constructionist Principle: Understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and ultimately our social reality are created through language and in conversation.</p>

<p>In other words: What we believe to be true is informed by and evolves through conversation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;If the way we talk together influences understanding, interpersonal dynamics, and teams, departments, and organizations (Constructionist Principle), then it makes sense to hold our beliefs lightly and to ask questions and make room for both new knowledge and new meaning.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Think back on yesterday and name three things you are grateful for?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you have a great conversation&hellip; an interpersonal connection&hellip;&nbsp; a moment of joy&hellip;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pause the show if you need more time.</p>

<hr />
<p>Think back on what the role you played in&nbsp; making these moments&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally: What&rsquo;s one thing you could do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>This could be playing an instrument, heading to the gym, or even just turning on your favorite song and really dancing to it.</p>

<hr />
<p>Stravros writes: A meaningful and successful life comes from following your passions and heart, acting from strengths, and using creative thinking to inspire possibility. Therefore, talk about and inspire passion, discover strengths, and make room for creative potential.</p>

      <p class="body text-start"><p>Today&rsquo;s Appreciative Narrative moment comes from Chapter 2 of The Joy of Appreciative Living by Jacqueline Kelm</p>

<p>In&nbsp; Appreciative Inquiry, the first principle is the Constructionist Principle; its essential idea is that we continuously create or construct stories about what is happening in our lives. The reality we experience is completely subjective, and it is seen through the unique lenses and filters through which we view the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>James Branch Cabell said &ldquo;The optimist proclaims we live in the best of all possible worlds, and the pessimist fears this is true.&rdquo; What world do you live in?&nbsp; A better question may be: what world do you&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to live in?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Think back on yesterday and name three things you are grateful for.</p>

<p>This could be a conversation&hellip; a moment of success&hellip; a moment of joy...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Feel free to pause&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What was your role in making these moments&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p>Finally:&nbsp;What&rsquo;s one thing you could do today, no matter how small, that will bring you joy?</p>

<p>This could be lunch with a friend, a walk around the block, curling up with a good book&hellip;</p>

<hr />
<p>Quote from one of Jaqualine Kelm&rsquo;s study participants:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The possibilities for framing a day are endless. If we don&rsquo;t make a conscious effort to decide... if we leave it up to the winds... it&rsquo;s like seaweed in the ocean. It goes wherever the current takes it. We need to make conscious choices and deliberately frame our day.&rdquo;</p>
